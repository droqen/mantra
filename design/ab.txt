I check social media, and it becomes a mild compulsion that grows into a worse one. Sometimes I hide the feed, but then what? What remains for me? In such a case I have made myself willfully blind to, or of, the foundational design that drives the platform. No... that just won't do.

I realized that the way to interact with social media is to read new posts all the time, or to make posts that chase this. There are peripheral actions but this, this lies at the very core, the very heart of the thing.

No.

I at the same time have found myself struggling to find a home for my games. Where is it that they belong, where?

I want a game that picks you up and then lets you go. Something that enriches you for a while.

The platform is named 'mantra' because of its explicit focus on repetition, on reflection, on doing the same thing again. What would happen if there was a social media based on things that you want to read, listen to, play, again and again, every day? (Or at some other rate you find comfortable?)

You do everything once and then you are free.
