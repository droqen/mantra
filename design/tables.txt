This is a txt file regarding the design of the MySQL tables. Keep it brief.

- posts
Anything posted by a user for inclusion on pages. For now a post may be one of Text, Music, or Game. I'll need different subtypes as well for versions and technology, how do I name those differently... "versions"?
	id
	author_userid
	playengineid // what engine and version will be used to play the post? we can also infer a simpler 'post type' from this id
	content // hmm, not sure if big text or not. let's go with a limited varchar of 256. ah, but to include nonenglish characters or go pure unicode or whatever...
	published (datetime) // specific timestamp when a post is posted

- playengines
	id
	label // an internal label
	shortlabel // a user-end label for describing what 'type' this is, e.g. is it games, music, etc

- users
	id
	username
	unsecure_pass // i will generate a password for you because i don't want to deal with security at the moment thanks

- pages
Possibly a user can make multiple pages? A page contains posts, but also activity, i.e. whether a user has played the game today, and how many users have played the game over how many days.
	id
	owner_userid

- post_on_page
	pageid
	postid

- post_played
Every post has both a played and an unplayed state. Text: you must write it over again by hand. Music: you play it start to finish without interrupting. Game: you play it and beat it of course. Visual art: IDK actually. Maybe no visual art? Video: same as music, but probably no video
An entry in post_played indicates that post "postid" has been played by user "userid" on the date indicated. That's it, no additional data necessary
	postid
	userid
	date

* in the long run it might be useful or necessary to create another table 'post_streak' or something -- in order to make looking up historical data of a post's playedness less expensive. For now it is fine.

.// using this set of tables, i can log in as a user. make a post that is mine, and assign to it a playengine. i can put that post on a page. i can mark the post as 'played today', and come back and play it the next day.
